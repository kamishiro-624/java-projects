Some Java util methods and projeccts; feel free to leave any suggestions.

## NOTES
### IntegerInput:
- None

### SeqTextReader:
- I know there's a built-in string method in Java that does the string splitting for you, but I wanted to practice string manipulation.

### javaTicTacToe:
- If you are struggling to get the right inputs, the board is like a keypad with inputs from 1-9.
